		Broccoli is an edible green plant in the cabbage family whose large flowering head is eaten as a vegetable.  Broccoli has large flower heads, usually green in color, arranged in a tree-like structure branching out from a thick, edible stalk. Broccoli is often boiled or steamed but may be eaten raw. a 100 gram serving of raw broccoli provides 34 kcal and is an excellent source (20% or higher of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin C and vitamin K. Raw broccoli also contains moderate amounts (10â€“19% DV) of several B vitamins and the dietary mineral manganese, whereas other essential nutrients are in low content. Broccoli has low content of carbohydrates, protein, fat, and dietary fiber.
